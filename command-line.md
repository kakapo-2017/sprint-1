The command line is like a back room on a computer where you can 'command' the computer to get it do specific things for you, or run the way you want it to. In order to 'command' the computer, you need to know the special language that the computer understands. This is what code is.
cd: this command is like the home button on google (takes you back to the place where you started)
open[file]: this opens a file, like double clicking on a file on your desktop
touch [file]: use this to create a new file
pwd: this stands for print working directory. This helps you to see where you're at
cd [folder]: this changes you to that directory or folder
mkdir [dir]: use this to make a new directory called [dir]
[command] -h: this is your help button
ls: use this to show a short listing of what you're working on
ls -l: use this to show a longer listing of what you're working on
ls -a: this will give you a listing of what you're working on, including hidden files.
reset: this resets the terminal display screen
